Please give me some perspective

To play with the Chrome Extension, do this:

If you don't have git installed, follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
Open a command window (eg. Terminal)
Type the following:

    cd ~
    mkdir code
    cd code
    git clone https://github.com/Moishe/some_perspective.git

In chrome, go to the [extensions page](chrome://extensions)

Click on the "Load Unpacked Extension" button.
Select the "extension" directory in /Users/[yourname]/code/some_perspective

Now try navigating to [a danger zone](http://paulgraham.com/ineq.html). You should see a warning banner at the top.
