Healthcare today is good, but far from the best it can be. It’s the result of approaching medicine according to practice and tradition, rather than real science primed by statistically validated data and conclusions. Healthcare must move away from the system of small trials and experiential evolution of best practices (which has done us well) to a state unencumbered with the conflicts of interest, personal biases, and incomplete knowledge that currently lead to suboptimal results. Doctors today are doing the best they can given the current system, but we should embrace the new opportunities ahead of us.

We'll guide you through developing your company narrative and what the VC thought process is while making an investment, not to mention basic tips and tricks, in addition to what works and what doesn't in fundraising decks. Read MoreThe goal of Team 360 reviews is to provide CEOs with valuable developmental and evaluative feedback from key stakeholders. Read MoreUnderstand and quantify your major risks and know what you have to prove to get your product to market. Read MoreCongratulations, you are now an executive at a venture-backed company! You survived the presentations, the term sheet shuffle and the due-diligence. Everyone is calling you the Founder (which is true), yet you are actually a technologist, an engineer or just a “great ideas person” with an instinct for the market. But now you have to recruit a team; perhaps, for example, a VP Marketing (maybe you have never been in a room with a real VP Marketing and don't really know what one does or how to assess his or her capabilities!) Worse still, you might be recruiting a CEO but have never really understood what a CEO does or how to appraise one. How do you evaluate a candidate, especially for a management role that you do not have great familiarity with?
