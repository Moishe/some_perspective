Healthcare today is good, but far from the best it can be. It’s the result of approaching medicine according to practice and tradition, rather than real science primed by statistically validated data and conclusions. Healthcare must move away from the system of small trials and experiential evolution of best practices (which has done us well) to a state unencumbered with the conflicts of interest, personal biases, and incomplete knowledge that currently lead to suboptimal results. Doctors today are doing the best they can given the current system, but we should embrace the new opportunities ahead of us. Read MoreThe “practice of medicine” developed through tradition, and the experiential evolution of best practices with small-scale medical research studies can be substantially improved through the “science of medicine” with statistically better-validated data and conclusions. Much of the current practice is driven by conclusions derived from partial information about a patient’s history and symptoms, incomplete medical understanding based as much on opinions as validated science, and interacting subjectively with known and unknown biases of the physician, hospital and healthcare system. Read MoreIn this talk, hear from Vinod Khosla about the future of health, how patients should be empowered to be the CEOs of their own health and some of the hardest questions facing society today. Read MoreToday's medicine is more practice than science, albeit intelligent practice. Too much is left to qualitative judgments based on tradition, experience and dated, often un-tested, beliefs. But we are about to make a quantum leap in the capabilities of medicine driven by digital health technologies, sensors and data science. It's only a matter of time before this leap in technology empowers individuals to become the CEOs of their own health. Read MoreIn this video, hear from Ginger.io founder/CEO, Anmol Madan, as he explains how the explosion in data and sensors transitions care from episodic data to continuous insight, which results in improved clinical outcomes and cost savings. Read More"Silicon Valley is not a place but a state of mind." – Vinod Khosla In this talk, Vinod will speak about the ways in which he's seeking to apply Silicon Valley principles and approaches to transform, even foster a revolution in, healthcare. We'll hear Vinod argue that much of what physicians do can be done better by well-designed sensors, passive and active data collectors and analytics without taking away the human element of care. Read MoreIn this video, hear Eric Topol, MD, chief academic officer of Scripps Health, talk about the creative destruction of medicine. Read MoreData-driven healthcare won't replace physicians entirely, but it will help those receptive to technology perform their jobs better.
