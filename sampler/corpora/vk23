At the annual KV CEO Summit, we were fortunate to have both Larry Page and Sergey Brin sit down to discuss a wide range of topics including the acquisition that never was (although not for lack of trying!), why computers today are still pretty bad, their partnership over the last 16 years, the future of Google, government 2.0 and how machine learning and technology will shape our future of abundance. Read MoreIn this video, hear from Zappos founder/CEO, Tony Hsieh, as he shares one of his core tenants – a great brand is a story that never stops unfolding –  and how that led to their focus on the redevelopment of downtown Las Vegas. Read MoreCritics have suggested that some profit-minded microfinance institutions (MFIs) have failed to lower interest rates and are exploiting the poor. Others think MFIs should be non-profits or "sustainable non-profit maximising" entities focussed solely on social outcomes. Read MoreIn 1997, a dozen heads of state  joined almost 3,000 participants from 137 countries in Washington, D.C. for the world’s first Microcredit Summit. During the summit, all agreed on an audacious objective: to reach 100 million of the world’s poorest  families, especially the women of those families, with credit for self-employment and other financial and business services by the end of 2005. Read MoreThe economic development of India’s 600 million strong rural population presents formidable challenges and also great opportunities. A model called RISC – Rural Infrastructural & Services Commons – is presented that has the potential for achieving the multi-faceted goals of sustainable economic development through more efficient utilization of available resources by focusing them into a minimum viable economic size. Read MoreThe Microcredit Summit Campaign (‘the Campaign’) has played a lead role in advocating for microfinance as one of the most important strategies to reduce poverty. Campaign data indicate that while the initial ‘100 million’ goal of the Campaign was a mammoth vision, participating microfinance institutions (MFIs) have converted much of its original audacity into quantifiable progress—making it one of the rare instances in history that the international community, led by civil society, set a collective, quantifiable, time-bound goal with global implications and impact and has come close to achieving it on time.
