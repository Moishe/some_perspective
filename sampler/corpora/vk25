I want to congratulate Shuji Nakamura (pictured above), the founder of Khosla Ventures portfolio company Soraa, and his fellow collaborators who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics yesterday. They join an esteemed group of Nobel laureates that includes Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and Niels Bohr, all of whom have changed the course of human history. Read MoreWe’ve believed for a long time that solving the world’s energy and resource problems will require a broad approach – no single technology or central institution can solve the problem alone, and it will require enterprises and consumers to each play an active role. Read MoreOn January 5, 2014, CBS’ 60 Minutes aired a segment titled, “The Cleantech Crash” that grossly misrepresented the state of the sustainable energy industry.  At Khosla Ventures, we are focused on finding real solutions for energy independence, rather than just pontificating. Read MoreIn this video, hear from Vinod Khosla as he compares LED lighting technology to the invention and adoption of smartphone technology and gives a look into the future with Soraa's GaN on Gan LED technology. Read MoreOil companies would have you believe that the goals of the fuel standard are either impossible or obscenely expensive. Since the LCFS was first passed in 2008, the oil industry has spent millions of dollars trying to convince legislators and the public that low-carbon alternatives don't exist or that they can't be produced in large enough volumes to meaningfully reduce demand for traditional fuels or that corn ethanol is the only biofuel technology around. This is one of the biggest myths perpetrated by oil companies. Read MoreClean tech as we see it continues to be a large opportunity – one that we believe will create significant impact and positive returns – despite what the pundits are saying. Clean tech as we see it continues to be a large opportunity – one that we believe will create significant impact and positive returns – despite what the pundits are saying. Read MoreWhen it comes to biofuels we have a few choices and options – we can do it poorly, with short- run approaches with no potential to scale, poor trajectory, and adverse environmental impact, or we can do it right – with sustainable, long-term solutions that can meet our biofuel needs and our environmental needs. We do need strong regulation to ensure land use abuses do not happen. Read MoreIn this video, Forbes' journalist, Kym McNicholas, talks with Vinod Khosla as he discusses ignoring experts, failure and the black swan thesis of energy transformation, among many other topics. Read MoreThe looming twin challenges of climate change and energy production are too big to be tackled by known solutions and time-­‐honored traditions. Incremental remedies are fine for incremental problems, but they are insufficient for monumental, potentially life-­‐altering threats, which need to be approached with a disruptive mindset. There are 5 billion people coveting the energy-­‐rich lifestyles currently enjoyed by 500 million people, mostly in the developed world. Read MoreClimate change is a substantial risk, and the risk of global inaction is real. In the long-­‐term, for rapidly developing nations, carbon intensity targets are more feasible than absolute carbon caps. In the near-­‐term, technology-­‐driven carbon reduction capacity building is more important than absolute carbon reductions.

The firm was founded in 2004 by Vinod Khosla, co-founder of Sun Microsystems.
