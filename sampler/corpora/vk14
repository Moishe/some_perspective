Read MoreFireside chat with Startup Grind founder, Derek Peterson, and Vinod Khosla on fearing failure as an entrepreneur and other lessons learned. Read MoreI want to congratulate Shuji Nakamura (pictured above), the founder of Khosla Ventures portfolio company Soraa, and his fellow collaborators who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics yesterday. They join an esteemed group of Nobel laureates that includes Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and Niels Bohr, all of whom have changed the course of human history. Read MoreIt’s never a dull moment when Vinod Khosla takes the stage with Michael Arrington: this year, we learn his thoughts on the forces that he thinks will shape the future, the things that make Silicon Valley culture worthwhile, and the dubious qualifications of VCs as advisors.
