There have been and will continue to be multiple big technology revolutions, but the most impactful on human society may be the one that finally builds systems with judgment and decision-making capability more sophisticated and nuanced than trained human judgment. Read MoreI want to congratulate Shuji Nakamura (pictured above), the founder of Khosla Ventures portfolio company Soraa, and his fellow collaborators who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics yesterday. They join an esteemed group of Nobel laureates that includes Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and Niels Bohr, all of whom have changed the course of human history. Read MoreAt the annual KV CEO Summit, we were fortunate to have both Larry Page and Sergey Brin sit down to discuss a wide range of topics including the acquisition that never was (although not for lack of trying!), why computers today are still pretty bad, their partnership over the last 16 years, the future of Google, government 2.0 and how machine learning and technology will shape our future of abundance. Read MoreIn this video, hear from Zappos founder/CEO, Tony Hsieh, as he shares one of his core tenants – a great brand is a story that never stops unfolding –  and how that led to their focus on the redevelopment of downtown Las Vegas. Read MoreIn this video, hear from Vinod Khosla as he compares LED lighting technology to the invention and adoption of smartphone technology and gives a look into the future with Soraa's GaN on Gan LED technology. Read MoreIn this video, hear from Vinod Khosla in a moderated discussion with Carnegie Mellon University provost, Mark Kamlet. Read MoreIn this video, Michael Arrington and Vinod Khosla discuss everything from being labeled "legendary" to high-tech beef companies.

Read MoreWe are in a whole new world of platforms, a post-PC era, which I’d more aptly describe as the always/everywhere era, finally, and that means a whole new set of opportunities. Add to it the fact that because of a variety of factors too numerous to cover here, the cost of experimentation has gone down dramatically (one can start a web startup or write an Android app with no more than a student credit card!) and raw computing power is taken for granted. Read MoreA.I. touches our lives in the form of chess computers that are better than most humans, computers beating the best humans at Jeopardy, intelligent ad targeting, Microsoft Kinect recognizing human motion and even amazingly, Google’s self-driving car that drove itself from San Francisco to Los Angeles.
